UV-VIS spectra are only available as PDF format, due to challenges with data export, and all chemical structures are provided as Molfiles and listed in a CSV according to their numbering in the publication, including local sample identifiers, SMILES structure codes, and InChI and InChIKey identifiers. A markdown README and a rendered HTML version provide an entry point for human readers. The corresponding scientific article does not reference the dataset as it was published one year before the dataset was published.",
