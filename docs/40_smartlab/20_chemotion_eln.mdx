Chemotion is the ELN reference instance in [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/). The software is developed by several developers at different NFDI4Chem sites. The development started at the [Karlsruhe institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/) as part of a DFG-funded project. The extension of the software was and is further supported by the [State Ministry of Baden-Wuerttemberg for Sciences, Research and Arts](https://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/).

The Chemotion ELN has been specifically designed for chemists, taking into account the unique requirements of chemical laboratory work and documentation. It serves as a powerful digitalization tool for chemistry, aimed at creating seamless workflows throughout the research life cycle. Achieving this vision is a collaborative effort involving continuous development, enhancement, and expansion of the ELN.

To get an overview on how and with which tools Chemotion ELN supports you throughout the whole [reseach data life cycle](docs/data_life_cycle), have a look at the flowchart below expanding the detailed information as you like.

## Data Life Cycle Support

### Planning 

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="10"/>

Chemotion assists in planning experiments by offering embedded *structure editors*, reading and generating *chemical identifiers*, and pulling information from *databases*.
<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  In the Chemotion ELN different entry types can be generated for planning various experimental setups. Generally, all entry types offer the possibility to draw chemical structures directly within the ELN. This is realized by embedded structure editors: *ketcher-rails* and *Ketcher 2* are integrated as default structure editors and furthermore *ChemDraw JS* and *Marvin JS* can be integrated when the needed licences are available.

  All structure editors directly convert the chemical structures into common chemical identifiers such as [*InChI*](https://www.inchi-trust.org/) and [*SMILES*](https://doi.org/10.1021%2Fci00057a005) code and automatically generate a MOL file of the chemical structure. Reversely, chemical structures can be generated in the ELN by importing the codes and files mentioned above and additionally [*CAS numbers*](https://www.cas.org/cas-data/cas-registry).

  The Chemotion ELN directly pulls information from and links entries to databases such as [*PubChem*](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and [*CAS SciFinder*](https://www.cas.org/solutions/cas-scifinder-discovery-platform/cas-scifinder). Thus, the planning of experiments is facilitated as all relevant information are automatically integrated into the ELN entries.

### Experiments

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="10"/>

During experiments Chemotion supports with *automated calculations*, *structured documentation*, and a *concise overview* of experimental information.
<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  As relevant information on chemical compounds such as molar mass, density, and purity are stored within the ELN, Chemotion automatically calculates all relevant amounts saving a researcher's time and preventing miscalculations and typos. Furthermore, predefined text snippets and the transfer of reaction information to the description of experiments allow for a fast and facile documentation.

  Due to structured and standardized input fields, the documentation takes place in an uniform and [metadata](docs/metadata)-enriched way. Thus, entries in the Chemotion ELN always give a full but still concise overview on all experimental information facilitating to conduct and document experiments in the laboratory.

</details>

### Data Generation

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="10"/>

For seamless workflows, *analytical devices* can be connected and directly accessed within the Chemotion ELN.
<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  Analytical data are usually already generated and stored fully digital. Oftentimes, a link of these data and the analytical devices to the laboratory notebook and the experiments is missing. Chemotion offers the possibility to connect analytical devices in the laboratory to the ELN via [device integration](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007). This not only allows for a connection of the devices to the ELN and experiments but also for a remote device control. Thus, analytical devices can be controlled, measurements started, and the progress of measurements monitored directly within the ELN independent on your location.

</details>

### Data Collection

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="10"/>

Besides the connection of analytical devices to the Chemotion ELN, data of these devices can be automatically transferred, file formats converted, and metadata mapped.
<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  When analytical devices are connected to the Chemotion ELN, data can easily be transferred to the ELN. By using the naming conventions of experimental entries in the ELN for analytical data to be transferred, these will be automatically deposited in the corresponding ELN entry. Thus, analytical data are seamlessly connected to experiments.

  Data of analytical devices might be stored in proprietary file formats depending on the devices used. For compliance with the [FAIR data principles](docs/fair), Chemotion is able to convert such files to the text-based, open source file format *JCAMP-DX*. The conversion is automatically performed after the transfer of data from analytical devices by the Chemotion tool [*ChemConverter*](https://chemotion.net/docs/services/chemconverter) whereupon both the proprietary file format and the converted file format are stored within the ELN.

  Generally, Chemotion supports researchers with their data collection by semi-automated metadata mapping. Here, Chemotion identifies and extracts metadata from analytical data files and writes them into the corresponding, standardized input fields.

## LabIMotion

In addition to its primary focus on chemistry, the ELN is also utilized in various other disciplines due to its versatile functionality that caters to the needs of scientists operating in interdisciplinary environments. These generic elements are continually being refined and adapted. The latest extension, introduced in November 2023, is [LabIMotion](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/labimotion), which enables users to incorporate entirely non-chemical functionalities by designing new modules.

## Chemotion Repository and other Connections

Chemotion ELN offers a specific functionality that facilitates the [publication of research data](/docs/data_publishing): it supports the transfer of data from a user's ELN account to a research data repository. This reduces the scientists' effort in allowing access to research data, which is required by many funding agencies and helpful for the publication of scientific journal articles. Currently, the ELN supports the transfer of data to the [Chemotion repository](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome). Additionally, Chemotion Repository is connected to other databases (e.g. [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)) and repositories (e.g. [NMRShiftDB2](https://nmrshiftdb.nmr.uni-koeln.de/), soon to be superseded by [nmrXiv](https://nmrxiv.org/)), to ensure best visibility and a user-friendly search of original research data. The NFDI4Chem team is working on establishing connections to further repositories, in particular, the repositories supported and recommended by NFDI4Chem.

A short introduction to the Chemotion ELN as well as the connection to the Chemotion repository is demonstrated in this video:
