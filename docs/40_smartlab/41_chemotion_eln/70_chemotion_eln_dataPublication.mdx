Chemotion ELN provides a dedicated functionality that facilitates the [publication of research data](/docs/data_publishing) by enabling seamless transfer from a user's ELN account to a [research data repository](/docs/repositories). Currently, the ELN supports data transfers to the [*Chemotion Repository*](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome) and [*RADAR4Chem*](https://radar4chem.radar-service.eu/radar/en/home). This feature allows researchers to easily transfer their research data, including semantic metadata, into a repository, thereby reducing their workload and helping meet the requirements set by funding agencies, while making their work available to their research community.

  
<img alt="nmrXiv Logo" src={useBaseUrl('/img/nmrXiv.svg')} width="200" align= "left" vspace="30" hspace="50"/>Furthermore, Chemotion ELN is connected to other repositories such as [*nmrXiv*](https://nmrxiv.org/) to ensure optimal visibility and facilitate user-friendly searches for original research data. The NFDI4Chem team is actively working on establishing connections to additional repositories, particularly those [supported and recommended by NFDI4Chem](/docs/choose_repository/). This ongoing effort aims to enhance accessibility and interoperability within the research community.
