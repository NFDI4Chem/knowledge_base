<br/>  
Chemotion offers a specific functionality that facilitates the [publication of research data](/docs/data_publishing): it supports the transfer of data from a user's ELN account to a [research data repository](/docs/repositories).  Currently, the ELN supports the transfer of data to the [*Chemotion Repository*](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome) and to [*RADAR4Chem*](https://radar4chem.radar-service.eu/radar/en/home). With this, reasearch data including semantic metadata can be easily transferred into a repository reducing a researcher's effort and helping to fulfill the requirements of funding agencies. Additionally, Chemotion is connected to other repositories such as [*nmrXiv*](https://nmrxiv.org/), to ensure best visibility and a user-friendly search of original research data. Continuously, the NFDI4Chem team is working on establishing connections to further repositories, in particular, the [repositories supported and recommended by NFDI4Chem](/docs/choose_repository/).
