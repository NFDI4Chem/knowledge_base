Chemotion ELN provides a dedicated functionality that facilitates the [publication of research data](/docs/data_publishing) by enabling seamless transfer from a user's ELN account to a [research data repository](/docs/repositories). Currently, the ELN supports data transfers to the [_Chemotion Repository_](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome) and [_RADAR4Chem_](https://radar4chem.radar-service.eu/radar/en/home).

This feature allows researchers to easily transfer their research data,
including semantic metadata, into a repository, thereby reducing their workload
and helping meet the requirements set by funding agencies, while making their
work available to their research community.

Furthermore, Chemotion ELN is connected to other repositories such as
[_nmrXiv_](https://nmrxiv.org/) to ensure optimal visibility and facilitate
user-friendly searches for original research data. The NFDI4Chem team is
actively working on establishing connections to additional repositories,
particularly those [supported and recommended by
NFDI4Chem](/docs/choose_repository/). This ongoing effort aims to enhance
accessibility and interoperability within the research community.

Chemotion ELN also provides researchers with the option to automatically generate supplemental information (SI) for their manuscripts. This includes direct references to the published datasets via their DOI.
