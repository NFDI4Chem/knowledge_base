After transfer and possible conversion of analytical data, these raw data have to be analyzed. In Chemotion, this can be done seamlessly utilizing one of the embedded spectra editors. [*NMRium*](https://www.nmrium.org/) is an online software for the processing of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra. Besides the processing of NMR spectra, chemical structures can be connected to the corresponding NMR signals directly within NMRium and thus the software allows for [FAIR](docs/fair) and machine-readable and -actionable analytic data.

Alternatively, spectra can be analyzed using [*ChemSpectra*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-020-00481-0). This software developed within Chemotion enables the processing of various analytical data such as NMR, IR, MS, UV/VIS, GC, HPLC, CV, XRD, and others. Depending on the analytical method, different options for the processing are available in ChemSpectra, i.e., picking peaks, integrating signals, or setting multiplicities.

After performing analyses, the processed analytical data are stored within the ELN entries together with the raw data and thus are connected directly to the experiments. As the processed data are saved in open file formats, these data are interoperable and can easily be reused.
