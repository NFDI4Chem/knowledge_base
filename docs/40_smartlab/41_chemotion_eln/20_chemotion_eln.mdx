Chemotion is the ELN reference instance in [NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/). The software is developed by several developers at different NFDI4Chem sites. The development started at the [Karlsruhe institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/) as part of a DFG-funded project. The extension of the software was and is further supported by the [State Ministry of Baden-Wuerttemberg for Sciences, Research and Arts](https://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/).

The Chemotion ELN has been specifically designed for chemists, taking into account the unique requirements of chemical laboratory work and documentation. It serves as a powerful digitalization tool for chemistry, aimed at creating seamless workflows throughout the research life cycle. Achieving this vision is a collaborative effort involving continuous development, enhancement, and expansion of the ELN.

To get an overview on how and with which tools Chemotion ELN supports you throughout the whole [reseach data life cycle](docs/data_life_cycle), have a look at the flowchart below expanding the detailed information as you like.

## Data Life Cycle Support

### Planning 

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="50"/>

Chemotion assists in planning experiments by offering embedded *structure editors*, reading and generating *chemical identifiers*, and pulling information from *databases*.

### Experiments
<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="50"/>

During experiments Chemotion supports with *automated calculations*, *structured documentation*, and a *concise overview* of experimental information.

<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  As relevant information on chemical compounds such as molar mass, density, and purity are stored within the ELN, Chemotion automatically calculates all relevant amounts saving a researcher's time and preventing miscalculations and typos. Furthermore, predefined text snippets and the transfer of reaction information to the description of experiments allow for a fast and facile documentation.

  Due to structured and standardized input fields, the documentation takes place in an uniform and [metadata](docs/metadata)-enriched way. Thus, entries in the Chemotion ELN always give a full but still concise overview on all experimental information facilitating to conduct and document experiments in the laboratory.

### Data Generation

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="50"/>

For seamless workflows, *analytical devices* can be connected and directly accessed within the Chemotion ELN.

<br/>
<br/>  
<br/> 

<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  Analytical data are usually already generated and stored fully digital. Oftentimes, a link of these data and the analytical devices to the laboratory notebook and the experiments is missing. Chemotion offers the possibility to connect analytical devices in the laboratory to the ELN via [device integration](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acax.2019.100007). This not only allows for a connection of the devices to the ELN and experiments but also for a remote device control. Thus, analytical devices can be controlled, measurements started, and the progress of measurements monitored directly within the ELN independent on your location.

</details>

### Data Collection

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="50"/>

Besides the connection of analytical devices to the Chemotion ELN, data of these devices can be automatically transferred, file formats converted, and metadata mapped.

<br/>
<br/>  
<br/> 

<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  When analytical devices are connected to the Chemotion ELN, data can easily be transferred to the ELN. By using the naming conventions of experimental entries in the ELN for analytical data to be transferred, these will be automatically deposited in the corresponding ELN entry. Thus, analytical data are seamlessly connected to experiments.

  Data of analytical devices might be stored in proprietary file formats depending on the devices used. For compliance with the [FAIR data principles](docs/fair), Chemotion is able to convert such files to the text-based, open source file format *JCAMP-DX*. The conversion is automatically performed after the transfer of data from analytical devices by the Chemotion tool [*ChemConverter*](https://chemotion.net/docs/services/chemconverter) whereupon both the proprietary file format and the converted file format are stored within the ELN.

  Generally, Chemotion supports researchers with their data collection by semi-automated metadata mapping. Here, Chemotion identifies and extracts metadata from analytical data files and writes them into the corresponding, standardized input fields.

### Analysis

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="50"/>

Analyses can be performed directly in the Chemotion ELN by utilizing one of the embedded *spectra editors*.

<br/>
<br/>  
<br/>
<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  After transfer and possible conversion of analytical data, these raw data have to be analyzed. In Chemotion, this can be done seamlessly utilizing one of the embedded spectra editors. [*NMRium*](https://www.nmrium.org/) is an online software for the processing of one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra. Besides the processing of NMR spectra, chemical structures can be connected to the corresponding NMR signals directly within NMRium and thus the software allows for [FAIR](docs/fair) and machine-readable and -actionable analytic data.
  
  Alternatively, spectra can be analyzed using [*ChemSpectra*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-020-00481-0). This software developed within Chemotion enables the processing of various analytical data such as NMR, IR, MS, UV/VIS, GC, HPLC, CV, XRD, and others. Depending on the analytical method, different options for the processing are available in ChemSpectra, i.e., picking peaks, integrating signals, or setting multiplicities.

  After performing analyses, the processed analytical data are stored within the ELN entries together with the raw data and thus are connected directly to the experiments. As the processed data are saved in open file formats, these data are interoperable and can easily be reused.

### Data Publication

<img alt="Placeholder" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ChemotionELN_Logo.png')} width="200" align="left" vspace="30" hspace="50"/>

The Chemotion ELN is connected to several *data repositories* which allows for simple and fast publication of research data.

<br/>
<br/>  
<br/>
<details>
  <summary>Detailed information</summary>

  Chemotion offers a specific functionality that facilitates the [publication of research data](/docs/data_publishing): it supports the transfer of data from a user's ELN account to a research data repository. Currently, the ELN supports the transfer of data to the [*Chemotion Repository*](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome) and to [*RADAR4Chem*](https://radar4chem.radar-service.eu/radar/en/home). With this, reasearch data including semantic metadata can be easily transferred into a repository reducing a researcher's effort and helping to fulfill the requirements of funding agencies. Additionally, Chemotion is connected to other repositories such as [*nmrXiv*](https://nmrxiv.org/)), to ensure best visibility and a user-friendly search of original research data. Continuously, the NFDI4Chem team is working on establishing connections to further repositories, in particular, the repositories supported and recommended by NFDI4Chem.

## LabIMotion

In addition to its primary focus on chemistry, the ELN is also utilized in various other disciplines due to its versatile functionality that caters to the needs of scientists operating in interdisciplinary environments. These generic elements are continually being refined and adapted. The latest extension, introduced in November 2023, is [LabIMotion](https://www.chemotion.net/docs/labimotion), which enables users to incorporate entirely non-chemical functionalities by designing new modules.
