## Introduction

The data availability statement is part of the back matter of a manuscript. The back matter usually also contains information on conflicts of interest, author information, acknowledgements and the references. 

The data availability statement enables **[linking of the manuscript](/docs/data/data_publication)** (via  **[PIDs](/docs/topics/pid)** such as DOIs, alternatively using the repository-specific identifiers or accession numbers) to the corresponding FAIR dataset in research data **[repositories](/docs/topics/repositories)**.
