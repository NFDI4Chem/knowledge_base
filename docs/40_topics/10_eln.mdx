# Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs)

# Introduction

The information technology is developing with a fast speed. The smartphones in our pockets are much faster than a supercomputer from the 80s. Unfortunately, this technology has not yet reached the chemical laboratories. The paper notebook is as popular as 100 years ago, and only little progress has been made into a direction of better research data management in the academic world.

Transferring the advancement of the information technology into the lab (smartlab) does not necessarily mean touch screens everywhere. Smartlab is more about the interconnectivity of the entire workflow and handling research data according to the [FAIR principles](01_fair.mdx). ELNs help to assign rich [metadata](30_metadata.mdx) to experiments and make the collected data traceable as well as reusable. With the possibility to transfer data from measurement devices directly into the ELN, the ELN is the central storage with all data in one place. From the ELN, data can be easily published into repositories and transferred to suitable long-term [archiving](50_data_storage.mdx).

One of the most important things, that distinguishes an ELN from a white blank paper is the possibility to document metadata in a structured way, ideally in a human and machine-readable way. See the following overview for more information on the differences between blank sheets, ELNs and laboratory information management systems (LIMS).

ELNs are a key prerequisite to a comprehensive, digital documentation of research data and are therefore of high importance capturing data for further analysis or a later re-use. ELNs are available as either a commercial, free, or even an Open Source solution. ELNs can be either discipline-agnostic or discipline-specific; some of them combine both aspects. The organization of work with ELNs that support chemistry-specific functions can offer several benefits such as the availability of [chemical structure identifiers](70_machine-readable_chemical_structures.mdx) and [standardized formats](40_format_standards.mdx) as well as the integration of manifold tools and workflows that facilitate scientific work. The direct integration of tools enables a direct support of the scientist without the need to search for additional services and software, thus bringing new developments and information directly to the scientists’ awareness. To date, only a few electronic lab notebooks meet the basic requirements for chemical sciences. This is most likely due to the challenges arising from drawing and processing chemical structures, a crucial and central step in being able to correlate research data to the corresponding chemical reaction or structure. Some Open Source examples for systems in chemistry that offer the necessary support for chemical structures include [Indigo-ELN](https://lifescience.opensource.epam.com/indigo/eln/index.html), [LabTrove](http://labtrove.org/), [OpenEnventory](http://www.open-enventory.de/), and [Chemotion ELN](https://eln.chemotion.net/home).

## Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) in NFDI4Chem

[NFDI4Chem](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/) will support those ELNs that are relevant for documentation of chemical research activities. This support will include hosting one ELN instance for each of the relevant ELNs at KIT for teaching and training purposes. This service will be established in 2022 to allow all scientists to compare ELNs and their functionalities. Comparing and testing different ELNs is a prerequisite for making the right choice. Furthermore, NFDI4Chem organizes various seminars with the goal of giving a first impression of different ELNs. These seminars are a good opportunity for ELN providers to demonstrate their ELN's usefulness and possible applications. For past and forthcoming seminars, please see the [Stammtisch event page](https://www.nfdi4chem.de/index.php/event/stammtisch-chemotion/).

## Chemotion ELN

Chemotion is the ELN reference instance in NFDI4Chem. The Chemotion ELN is developed by several software developers at different NFDI4Chem sites. The ELN development started at the [Karlsruhe institute of Technology (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/) in Karlsruhe as part of a DFG-funded project. The extension of the software was and is further supported by the [State Ministry of Baden-Wuerttemberg for Sciences, Research and Arts](https://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/), the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/).

The Chemotion ELN was designed for chemists and adapted to the special requirements of chemical laboratory work and documentation. It therefore serves as a digitalization instrument for work in chemistry, developed to overcome the current limitations of the existing systems. To reach this goal, the development, improvement, and extension of the ELN is a community effort. The ELN is also used in other disciplines beyond chemistry as it offers a broad generic functionality to meet the needs of scientists working in interdisciplinary environments. These generic functions are still being extended and adapted.

Chemotion ELN offers a specific function that facilitates the [publication of research data](../30_data/60_data_publication.mdx): it supports the transfer of data from a user's ELN account to a research data repository. This function reduces the scientists' effort in allowing access to research data, which is required by many funding agencies and helpful for the publication of scientific text publications. Currently, the ELN supports the transfer of data to the [Chemotion repository](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome). The NFDI4Chem team is working on establishing connections to further repositories, in particular, the repositories supported and recommended by NFDI4Chem.

A short introduction to the Chemotion ELN as well as the connection to the Chemotion repository is demonstrated in this video:

### Documentation, information, and contact

Chemotion ELN an its functions were described in various publications (see [below](#sources-and-further-information)). For users, developers, and admins, a documentation is available via the project's [website](https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/intro). Chemotion ELN is an Open Source development; the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN).
