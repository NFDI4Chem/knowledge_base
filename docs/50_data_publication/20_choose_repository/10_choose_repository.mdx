# Choose a Repository

The NFDI4Chem aims to support researchers in collecting, storing, processing, analysing, publishing, and reusing research data. Based on the [NFDI4Chem Community Survey](https://doi.org/10.1002/zaac.202000339), a list of the most [common data types and formats](/docs/pub_data_types_formats) of the community has been compiled to suggests suitable trusted chemistry-friendly repositories.

This decision tree will guide users to quickly select a suitable repository for publishing their research data!

:::danger Notice:
Choosing the most appropriate repository can make data easier to find and cite. Field-specific repositories should be the first choice as these repositories enhance the FAIRness of specific types of chemistry data on behalf of the submitters. To retain the same level of FAIRness, data publishing in generic, multidisciplinary repositories requires manual, time-consuming and labour-intensive FAIRification.
:::

Based on the [criteria](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.6.e55852) chosen by Task Area 3, NFDI4Chem also offers recommendations with essential information on chemistry-friendly repositories that are suitable and trustworthy, as outlined in the following lists.

## Core Repositories

-   [Chemotion Repository](/docs/chemotion_repository)<br/>Field-specific sample and reaction-centric repository including analysis data such as NMR, UV-VIS, IR, and MS data.
-   [MassBank EU](/docs/massbank_eu/)\*<br/>Field-specific ecosystem of databases and tools for mass spectrometry reference spectra.
-   [nmrXiv](/docs/nmrxiv/)<br/>Field-specific repository for NMR data.
-   [RADAR4Chem](/docs/radar4chem/)<br/>Generic, multidisciplinary repository that offers a free and reliable home for all chemical research data that do not fulfil the specifications of field-specific repositories.
-   [STRENDA DB](/docs/strenda_db/)<br/>Field-specific repository for enzymology data, which incorporates the STRENDA Guidelines for reporting enzymology data.
-   [SUPRABANK](/docs/suprabank/)<br/>Field-specific repository for intermolecular interactions data.

\*Resource which does not accept direct submission of MS data in vendor or mzML format, but data in MassBank format, see [RMassBank](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RMassBank.html).

## Associated repositories

-   [Cambridge Structural Database](/docs/csd_icsd/)\*<br/>Field-specific repository for x-ray diffraction data of molecules generally containing at least carbon and hydrogen, operated by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC).
-   [Inorganic Crystal Structure Database](/docs/csd_icsd/)\*<br/>Field-specific repository for x-ray diffraction data of inorganic compounds, elements, minerals, intermetallic phases and ionic solids, operated by FIZ Karlsruhe.
-   [Joint CCDC/FIZ Access Structures Service](/docs/csd_icsd/)<br/>Service that provides open access to the CSD Structure Depot, but not to all CSD data.

\*Resource for which a license agreement is required.

## Further Repositories

-   [NOMAD](/docs/nomad/)<br/>Field-specific repository for computational materials science data.
-   [ioChem-BD](https://www.iochem-bd.org/)<br/>Field-specific repository for computational chemistry data.
-   [RADAR](https://www.radar-service.eu/radar/en/home)\*<br/>Generic, multidisciplinary repository for all types of chemical research data that do not meet the specifications of any field-specific repository.
-   [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)<br/>Generic repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program, operated by CERN.
-   [EUDAT B2SHARE](https://sp.eudat.eu/catalog/resources/709c053d-3b3f-4c54-8ef4-6efeea387816)<br/>Generic repository operated by a pan-european network consisting of more than 25 research organisations, data and computing centers.

\*Resource for which a license agreement is required.

## Currently under Development within NFDI4Chem

-   [VibSpecDB](https://vibspecdb.k8s.photonicdata.science/)<br/>Filed-specific repository for IR and Raman data.

:::danger Notice:
We published an [analysis of the landscape of repositories for chemistry research data in re3data](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8347992) and [criteria for chemistry repositories](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.8199754) on Zenodo. These lists will be continuously updated with further recommendations on trusted and chemistry-friendly repositories.
