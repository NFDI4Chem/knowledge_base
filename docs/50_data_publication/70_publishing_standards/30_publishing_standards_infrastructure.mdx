# A Simple Guide for Data Publishing Infrastructure Providers

As an infrastructure provider, facilitating data sharing is vital for enhancing research accessibility and collaboration within the scientific community. This guide outlines essential recommendations and considerations for improving data publishing practices in your repositories. It takes into consideration that most researchers publish their research data alongside an article published in an academic journal.

This guide is based on our standards for data publishing for infrastructure providers. You can view the full list of standards [at the end of this article](#standards-infrastructure-list).

## 1. Metadata Should Be Part of a Dataset

Research data repositories should include standardised, machine-readable metadata in datasets downloaded by researchers and exchanged with other resources. Generic and technical metadata are  associated with the dataset during its upload process, while domain-specific repositories extract metadata from analytical data files provided by researchers along their lab workflows (e.g., [Chemotion ELN](https://chemotion.net/)). Once data is retrieved, this metadata should remain intact in the downloaded package, with descriptive [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) metadata as a minimum requirement. One solution to ensure reliable file transfer is to use [BagIt](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8493.html), which enables inclusion of metadata in downloaded datasets.

## 2. Incorporate Structured Domain-Specific Metadata

Research data repositories should incorporate structured, domain-specific metadata in datasets downloaded by researchers and exchanged with other resources. Beyond generic schemes like [DataCite's metadata schema](https://schema.datacite.org/), including Schema.org metadata through tools like [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/) or combining RO-Crate with BagIt enhances both reliability and richness of metadata. By including information on context of a particular domain, domain-specific metadata enhance data relevance, accuracy, and consequently re-usability.

## 3. Inform Authors on Legal Issues on Dataset Abstracts 

Repositories should inform authors about possible rights conflicts when using related article abstracts as descriptions within dataset fields; separate descriptions are recommended instead due copyright concerns.

## 4. Group Licenses According to Type

[Licenses](/docs/licences) offered by research data repositories should be grouped into categories distinguishing between research data licenses and software licenses; this simplifies selection processes for users navigating lengthy lists.

## 5. Encourage Creative Commons Licenses 

To streamline license selection, infrastructure providers should direct authors towards opting for [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) when publishing research data—licensing options no more restrictive than [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) are strongly recommended.

## 6. Promote Least Restrictive Creative Commons Licenses 

To foster openness within shared datasets, repositories ought to suggest licenses on handling data such as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) or [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) over more restrictive alternatives like [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) or [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) which may inhibit reuse opportunities; shared works ought to be **as open as possible**, allowing others maximum freedom in utilization efforts!

## 7. Creators, Authors, and Contributors 

Researchers typically refer to individuals involved in the publication of results as authors, particularly when working with scientific publishers. However, [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) differentiates between authors and contributors, with contributors being assigned specific roles. To minimize confusion for researchers publishing their data, repositories should assist by labeling the field for creators in their (DataCite) metadata editors as **_Authors/Creators_**. 

## 8. Include Publisher Information in DataCite Metadata

Research data repositories should include their name as `'publisher'` along with a `'publisherIdentifier'` in each dataset's DataCite metadata fields automatically populated by the repository system without user edits allowed.

### Example:
>Publisher: RADAR4Chem
>
>publisherIdentifier: http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJNAY
>
>publisherIdentifierScheme: re3data 
>
>schemeURI: https://re3data.org/

In XML:
```xml
<publisher xml:lang="en" publisherIdentifier="http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJNAY" publisherIdentifierScheme="re3data" schemeURI="https://re3data.org/">RADAR4Chem</publisher>
```

This ensures clear identification of where each dataset has been published both for humans and machines alike.

## 9. Provide Collection DOIs to Wrap Multiple Datasets

Research data repositories should provide a Collection DOI that wraps relevant research data objects associated with a single article intended for publication. While field-specific repositories may offer DOIs for individual chemical reactions or molecules, multidisciplinary repositories provide DOIs for entire published datasets. To facilitate manuscript submission processes, each repository should enable authors to generate a [**Collection DOI**](https://chemotion.net/docs/repo/doi) that encompasses pertinent data referenced in their [data availability statements](/docs/data_availability_statement).

## 10. Provide Access to Read-Only Datasets Under Review

To facilitate inclusion of datasets in manuscript review processes, research data repositories should provide access to datasets under review through an accessible URL while maintaining non-editable status until the review has been completed.

## 11. Utilize URLs for Reviewer Access 

URLs accessing datasets under review should have access credentials encoded within them rather than requiring separate login information—this avoids potential errors during communication between reviewers and submission systems.

## 12. Allow Metadata Corrections and Updates 

Research data repositories should permit researchers to correct and update metadata due to potential errors during initial entry—Data/Metadata versioning may enhance transparency regarding changes made over time while enriching overall dataset descriptions according to [FAIR principles](/docs/fair/) ([F2](/docs/fair/#f2-data-are-described-with-rich-metadata-defined-by-r1-below)). This also llows authors to update datasets with correspnding article DOIs in cases where the data has been published before article acceptance or publication.

## 13. Provide Access to Metadata During Embargo Period

Datasets published under an embargo period should restrict access to the dataset while ensuring that its metadata remain accessible—*publish* with embargo. This practice allows relevant information about the dataset to be retrievable, in accordance to [FAIR principles](/docs/fair/) ([A2](/docs/fair/#a2-metadata-are-accessible-even-when-the-data-are-no-longer-available)), while granting authors first rights to their data.

## 14. Contribute to and Use Scholix.org Framework

Research data repositories should contribute to and utilize [Scholix.org](https://scholexplorer.openaire.eu/) as it provides a framework for improving links between scientific literature and research data across various digital objects. Scholix hubs such as [DataCite](https://datacite.org/) or [OpenAire](https://www.openaire.eu/) contribute valuable information on connected digital objects, allowing academic publishers to discover corresponding datasets even after articles have been published.
