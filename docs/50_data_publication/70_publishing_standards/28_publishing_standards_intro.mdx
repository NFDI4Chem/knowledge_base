:::info Info:
Authors, academic publishers and research data infrastructure providers are the target audiences for these standards.
:::

On these pages we collect a non-exhaustive list of data publishing standards, formulated as principles, that have been developed within the NFDI4Chem Publication Standards project. These standards are intended to implement the [FAIR Data Principles](/docs/fair/) with respect to data publishing workflows. The main objective of these standards is to improve the quality of metadata and streamline publishing workflows, including the manuscript peer-review process with corresponding datasets published in research data repositories.

Click on a button below to get started with standards for authors, academic publishers and infrastructure providers. These standards will be continuously updated.

:::danger Notice:
For more generic information for authors on publishing in field-specific and generic, multidisciplinary repositories such as publishing data in open formats or providing machine-readable chemical structures alongside the analytical data, please have a look to our page on [Best-Practices](/docs/best_practice/).
