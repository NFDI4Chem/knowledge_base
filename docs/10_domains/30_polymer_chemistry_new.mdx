## Introduction

The toolbox for monomer synthesis and modification, their polymerization as well as post-functionalization are often translated form organic chemistry, yet for cutting-edge materials new experimental strategies have to be developed. Many characterization methods, especially for monomers or small polymers, can also be adapted from established organic chemistry. However, since macromolecules can feature highly complex structures, e.g. brushes, dendrimers, rings and star shapes, advanced methods such as (2D) SEC, LCCC, DOSY NMR, or electron microscopy need to be applied in order to obtain an exhaustive structure determination (for abbreviations see table below). For their subsequent application as high-tech material, their mechanical and physical properties play an important role as well, where cyclic voltammetry or rheological characterization are just a few examples for the vast array of techniques that are available. 

## Data Types:

Data can be collected during the experiment through online methods, drawing samples on a specific schedule, or after the experiment by analyzing the obtained product. This leads to manually determined data: Experimental observations such as colour change or precipitants, appearance, yield and consistency of the product, solubility etc.

Digital data are obtained with analytical devices. Raw data files in proprietary file formats should be saved alongside interoperable open file formats by using converters or the software of the analytical device. If no specific open format is currently available, exporting as .txt or .csv is recommended. Please be aware that metadata included in the header of .txt or .csv files may not follow a defined (open) format and metadata should be additionally also added into the ELN.

## ELN
General chemistry ELNs can typically be used for analytical chemistry data and may be well suited to your research topic. However, there are also specialised tools that are tailored to the needs of analytical chemists. These tools often include features for managing instrument data, processing raw data files and visualising results. They may also include tools for chemometric analysis.

## Publishing Data

In an effort to realize research data management in line with the FAIR principles, the data can be published in a repository including raw and processed data for reuse. ELN offer an export interface to some repositories. E.g. the use of the Chemotion-ELN enables a direct transfer of research data and the respective metadata into the Chemotion Repository. Subsequently, these data are automatically shared with other repositories, e.g. PubChem. 
For the publication of research data in other discipline-specific repositories, data have to be exported from the ELN and uploaded into the respective database.

In order to reach as many researchers as possible, choosing the right repository can be crucial (more on this in the [article on choosing the right repository](/docs/choose_repository/)).

Here is a table giving an overview of what data fits into what repository:

Your own institution may also have additional guidelines & resources for publishing data, therefore it is always worth consulting the research data management experts of your local institution.

## Challenges

While for some data types & workflows it may be obvious how to comply with the FAIR principles, for others it is not as no community standards have been set and/or no appropriate open data formats are available. This is especially true for more niche analytical methods. Remember though: FAIR is a spectrum not an absolute. Therefore even if one of your workflows may not be as FAIR as the other, if it is as FAIR as is currently possible then it is still worth doing.

Many old devices do not put out open-data formats and some devices have no digital output at all which makes good RDM more challenging though not impossible given the right tools (e.g. Chemotionâ€™s ChemConverter which automatically generates open file formats from analytical devices which are not capable of outputting them).

One of the biggest challenges to RDM in Chemistry at the moment is the lack of inter-ELN interoperability. This means that it is very challenging if not impossible to transfer data between different ELNs. This makes it especially challenging for interdisciplinary collaborations where collaborating groups use different ELNs. There are, however, efforts underway to establish inter-ELN interoperability such as the ELN consortium of which Chemotion is a member.
