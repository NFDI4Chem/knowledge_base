# Data Management Plan (DMP)

## Introduction

A data management plan is a document that outlines how data will be handled during and after a research project to secure the preservation of the data and their metadata. Ideally, a DMP is created before the data collection begins. This ensures that file structures, formats, metadata standards, and access controls are planned consistently and transparently from the outset. DMPs can be used as part of quality and project management, and should be updated whenever changes in handling research data are made.

A DMP answers the W-questions for documentation:

> "In a DMP a researcher or research team describes **What** data goes into a project (reuse) and comes out of it (potential reuse), **How** the team takes care of the data, and **Who** is allowed to do **What** with the data **When**."<sup>[1](https://www.openaire.eu/blogs/why-is-this-a-good-data-management-plan)</sup>

In addition, the data management plan also addresses cross-cutting issues such as standards, ethics, responsibilities, and so on.

A structured, sustainable, and accessible approach to handling research data in line with the FAIR principles. :::

## Why is a DMP important?

A good DMP offers many practical benefits for everyday research:

**Scientific & organisational benefits**

-   Structured data documentation: Supports consistent workflows
-   Facilitates collaboration: Especially useful in interdisciplinary or multi-site projects
-   Knowledge transfer: Helps new team members get up to speed faster
-   Reduces data loss: By planning backups and secure storage strategies early

**Visibility & reproducibility**

-   Increases reusability: Clear metadata and standardized formats improve data usability for others
-   Enhances research integrity: Transparent documentation enables reproducibility and trust

**Compliance with funders**

-   A DMP or considerations of handling research data are often required by funding agencies (e.g., EU, DFG, BMFTR)
-   It supports Open Science practices, compliance with the FAIR data principles and long-term data accessibility

## What topics should a DMP cover?

In chemistry, a DMP typically addresses the following questions:

-   What kind of data will be generated?
    e.g., spectra, chromatograms, reaction parameters, synthesis steps
-   How will the data be documented?
    Including metadata standards and tools (e.g., ELNs, repositories, guidelines)
-   Where and how will the data be stored?
    Local infrastructure, institutional servers, cloud services
-   Who will have access to the data?
    Access rights, handling of sensitive data, role-based access control
-   How will the data be shared, published and/or archived?
    Repositories like RADAR4Chem and Zenodo, DOI assignment, long-term availability
-   What about legal, ethical, or copyright issues?
    Especially relevant in collaborative or industrial research settings
    Includes e.g., the selection of licenses and compliance with contractual or institutional requirements

## Which tool can I use to write a DMP?

The Research Data Management Organizer (RDMO) is a free online tool that is specifically designed to support the creation and management of DMPs.

**Benefits of using RDMO:**

-   Supports your project throughout its entire life cycle, from planning to data publication and beyond
-   Centralizes all relevant data management tasks and information in one place
-   Available in both English and German
-   Includes multiple DMP templates adaptable to different funder requirements
-   Enables collaboration by assigning tasks to project partners and team members
-   Offers import/export functions and supports a variety of download formats for further processing

## How do I get support in writing my DMP?

NFDI4Chem offers a chemistry-specific Data Management Plan (DMP) template designed to guide researchers through the process of writing a DMP by answering structured questions. This template is based on a checklist provided by the German Research Foundation (DFG), enriched with chemistry-relevant content and supplemented with additional questions to ensure clarity and completeness.
The catalogue of questions is available as a downloadable text document or can be used directly within the Research Data Management Organizer (RDMO).
